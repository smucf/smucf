# Deployment

Currently a manual process since deployment of infra isn't very frequent.

ssh into the server and pull this repository, then deploy with `sudo docker-compose up -d`.

In order to ssh into the server, you'll need to first have your public key authorised.

Contact `im@arnmk.com` for more details.
